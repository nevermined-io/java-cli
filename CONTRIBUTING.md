# Contributing Guide

## Reporting an Issue
The easiest way you can contribute to Nevermined is by creating issues. 
For that, please use the [issues][issues] section of the Nevermined repository and search for a similar problem. 
If you don't find it, submit your bug, question, proposal or feature request.

In the case of bugs, please be descriptive and, if possible, include a screenshot of the issue.

## Creating Pull Requests

Before sending a Pull Request with significant changes, please use the [issue tracker][issues] to discuss the potential improvements you want to make.

## First-Time Contributors

We always have tickets labeled ['good first issue'][goodFirstIssues] and ['help wanted'][helpWantedIssues]. These are a great starting point if you want to contribute. Don't hesitate to ask questions about the issue if you are not sure about the strategy to follow.

## Requesting a Feature

We are open to hear your ideas for new features! 

For that, you can create an issue and select the "Feature Proposal" template. Fill in as much information as possible.

## Next Steps

Once you have your environment set and ready to go, you can check our [documentation][documentationHomepage] and the project's [Roadmap][roadmap] to see what's coming.
